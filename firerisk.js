* This javascript is based of a python script that was used to control and update
* a LED strip via a Raspberry Pi. Py script would open a websocket and read and
* parse a text file with a nine digit color code. Then it would update the LED.
* The script had to run for an unknown length, and most likely it was several hours.
* It was part of a bigger hi-fi prototype of an IoT system, which had to work after
* being plugged in, without any support team.
